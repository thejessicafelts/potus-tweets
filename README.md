# POTUS Tweets

This project seeks to take information made available by The White House, and create a list of tweets from the @POTUS twitter account. Users click a button called "New Tweet" and the next tweet in the sequence displays. Tweets are displayed in reverse chronological order. This project will serve as an archieve of sorts, in the case of these tweets being deleted by the upcoming administration.
